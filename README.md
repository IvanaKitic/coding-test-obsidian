# Obsidian Coding Test

This is a front-end project built for the Obsidian coding test.
It uses:

- HTML
- SCSS (compiled with Parcel)
- JavaScript
- Parcel for bundling

## Getting Started

To preview the production build locally, you can use a simple static server:

Option 1: Using serve (Recommended)
If you donâ€™t already have it, install the serve package globally:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install -g serve
Then run the server from your project folder:
serve dist
This will start a local server, usually at:
http://localhost:3000
Open that URL in your browser to view the production build.
